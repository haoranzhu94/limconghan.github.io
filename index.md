I am an AI resident at Uber ATG, Uber's self-driving divison. 
I was previously a postdoc at Georgia Tech ISYE working with Shabbir Ahmed, and before that at the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery at UW-Madison working with Jeffrey Linderoth, James Luedtke, and Stephen Wright.

My research focuses on algorithms for machine learning and operations research, generally with the goal of making hard problems more tractable.
Some topics I've tackled include robustness verification for neural networks, structured regression, distributed optimization, and mixed-integer nonconvex optimization.

I obtained my PhD in Computer Sciences at UW-Madison, and before that my BSc in
Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Chicago.

## Other Stuff

I did two internships - at Technicolor R&D (now under InterDigital)
and at Facebook.

A good chunk of my free time geeking out over films. 
**In Chicago**, check out [Doc Films](http://docfilms.uchicago.edu/), [Facets
Cinematheque](http://www.facets.org/cinematheque/), [Gene Siskel Film Center](https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org/), and [Music Box Theatre](https://www.musicboxtheatre.com/). 
**In Madison**, the [UW Cinematheque](http://cinema.wisc.edu) has impeccable programming. Madison is also home to film theorists David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson, who have [one of my favorite film blogs](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/). 
If you want **streaming sites** that offer something a little different, try [Mubi](https://mubi.com/) or [The Criterion Channel](https://www.criterionchannel.com/).

I am from Singapore. We have great food there.
