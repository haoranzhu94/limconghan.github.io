I am currently a research fellow at the Fall 2017 Semester Program on
"Bridging  Continuous and Discrete Optimization" at the Simons Institute for
TCS. I am also a postdoc in the Optimization group at UW-Madison, Wisconsin
Institute for Discovery.

I obtained my PhD from the Department of Computer Sciences at
UW-Madison, and did my undergraduate studies at University of Chicago in
Mathematics and Computer Science.
