I am a postdoc in the Optimization group at the Wisconsin Institute for
Discovery, UW-Madison. I am currently a research fellow at the Fall 2017

Institute for the Theory of Computing.

I obtained my PhD from the Department of Computer Sciences at
UW-Madison, and did my undergraduate studies at University of Chicago in
Mathematics and Computer Science.
