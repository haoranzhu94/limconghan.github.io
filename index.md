I am a postdoc in the Optimization group at the Wisconsin Institute for
Discovery, UW-Madison. I spent the Fall 2017 semester as a research fellow at
the Program at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, attending the
program on "Bridging Continuous and Discrete Optimization"

I obtained my PhD from the Department of Computer Sciences at
UW-Madison, and did my undergraduate studies at University of Chicago in
Mathematics and Computer Science.
