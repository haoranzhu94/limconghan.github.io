I am an ARC-TRIAD postdoc in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at
Georgia Tech working with Shabbir Ahmed. I was previously in the optimization
group at the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery @ UW-Madison working with
Jeffrey Linderoth, James Luedtke, and Stephen Wright. I obtained my PhD
in Computer Sciences at UW-Madison, and before that
my BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Chicago.

My research focuses on algorithms for machine learning and operations research.
This includes developing methods for regression problems, large-scale
stochastic programming, routing problems, and problems involving permutations.

## Other Stuff

I did two summer internships during my PhD -- working on DNA storage at
Technicolor Research Bay Area in 2015 and ML pipelines at Facebook in 2012.

A good chunk of my free time geeking out over films. 
**In Chicago**, check out
[Doc Films](http://docfilms.uchicago.edu/), [Facets
Cinematheque](http://www.facets.org/cinematheque/), [Gene Siskel Film
Center](https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org/), and [Music Box
Theatre](https://www.musicboxtheatre.com/). **In Madison**, the [UW
Cinematheque](http://cinema.wisc.edu) has impeccable programming. Madison is
also home to film theorists David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson, who have
[one of my favorite film blogs](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/). If you want
**streaming sites** that offer something a little
different, try [Filmstruck](https://www.filmstruck.com/us/) and
[Mubi](https://mubi.com/).
