I am a postdoc in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at
Georgia Tech. I was previously in the optimization group at the Wisconsin
Institute for Discovery, UW-Madison, and I spent the Fall 2017 semester as a
research fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing (program on
"Bridging Continuous and Discrete Optimization").

I obtained my PhD from the Department of Computer Sciences at
UW-Madison, and did my undergraduate studies at University of Chicago in
Mathematics and Computer Science.
