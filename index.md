I am a Member of Research Staff at Voleon. 
I spent my postdoc years at Uber ATG, Georgia Tech ISyE, Simons Institute for TCS, and Wisconsin Institute for Discovery. 
And before that I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at UW-Madison working with Jeff Linderoth, Jim Luedtke, and Steve Wright.

My academic research focuses on developing algorithms for machine learning and operations research, generally with the goal of making hard problems more tractable.
Some topics I've tackled include robustness verification, structured regression, distributed/parallel optimization, and mixed-integer nonconvex optimization.

## Other Stuff

A good chunk of my free time geeking out over films. 
**In Chicago**, check out [Doc Films](http://docfilms.uchicago.edu/), [Facets
Cinematheque](http://www.facets.org/cinematheque/), [Gene Siskel Film Center](https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org/), and [Music Box Theatre](https://www.musicboxtheatre.com/). 
**In Madison**, the [UW Cinematheque](http://cinema.wisc.edu) has impeccable programming. Madison is also home to film theorists David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson, who have [one of my favorite film blogs](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/). 
If you want **streaming sites** that offer something a little different, try [Mubi](https://mubi.com/) or [The Criterion Channel](https://www.criterionchannel.com/). 
Between Netflix and Amazon, I would recommend Netflix for their original content and Amazon for quirkier stuff.
