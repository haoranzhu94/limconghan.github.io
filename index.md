I am an ARC-TRIAD postdoc in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at
Georgia Tech working with Shabbir Ahmed. I was previously in the optimization
group at the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery @ UW-Madison working with
Jeffrey Linderoth, James Luedtke, and Stephen Wright. 

My research studies algorithms for machine learning and operations research.
This includes developing methods for regression problems, large-scale
stochastic programming, distributed optimization, mixed-integer nonconvex optimization, routing problems, and problems involving permutations.

I obtained my PhD in Computer Sciences at UW-Madison, and before that my BSc in
Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Chicago.

## Other Stuff

I did two summer internships during my PhD at
Technicolor Research Bay Area in 2015 and at Facebook in 2012.

A good chunk of my free time geeking out over films. 
**In Chicago**, check out
[Doc Films](http://docfilms.uchicago.edu/), [Facets
Cinematheque](http://www.facets.org/cinematheque/), [Gene Siskel Film
Center](https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org/), and [Music Box
Theatre](https://www.musicboxtheatre.com/). **In Madison**, the [UW
Cinematheque](http://cinema.wisc.edu) has impeccable programming. Madison is
also home to film theorists David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson, who have
[one of my favorite film blogs](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/). If you want
**streaming sites** that offer something a little
different, try [Mubi](https://mubi.com/) or [The Criterion Channel](https://www.criterionchannel.com/).
