I am a postdoc in the Optimization group at UW-Madison, Wisconsin Institute
for Discovery. I am currently a research fellow at the Fall 2017 Program on
"Bridging Continuous and Discrete Optimization" at the Simons Institute for
the Theory of Computing.

I obtained my PhD from the Department of Computer Sciences at
UW-Madison, and did my undergraduate studies at University of Chicago in
